# BankingLedger
A simple banking ledger web app that allows for recording deposits and withdrawals to a viewable ledger. 

This app requires the registration of an account in order to use the ledger facilities.  The email required for registration is not verified
but must be in the general format of a standard email address (no spaces, @ sign required, etc.)

The transaction history is saved in the session data and will not persist once the user logs out of the account or when the session expires.
